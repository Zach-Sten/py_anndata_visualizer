# Py_Anndata_Visualizer

Py_Annotaiton_Visualizer or PyAV for short is a tool meant to help bring anndata into a more interactive format to explore data. It is heavily inspired by Xenium Explorer and CellxGene and allows users to toggle through aspects of their data, visualize observation and gene expression and select regions of interest to be saved to the anndata object.
